# The Crow Eye Algorithm

A sophisticated bio-inspired AI algorithm that models collective intelligence, ethical decision-making, and fractal pathfinding through simulated crow swarm behavior for environmental threat detection and response.

## Algorithm Overview

The **Crow Eye Algorithm** combines multiple AI techniques to create emergent swarm intelligence:

- **Bayesian Threat Assessment**: Probabilistic threat prioritization with distance weighting
- **Fractal L-System Pathfinding**: Levy flight patterns for optimal search coverage  
- **Democratic Ethical Voting**: Collective decision-making for human intervention
- **Adaptive Memory Systems**: Experience-based learning and threat recall
- **Energy-Constrained Behavior**: Realistic resource management affecting decisions

## Core Algorithm Components

### 1. **Bayesian Threat Prioritization**
```java
priority = (threat_weight * intensity) / (1 + distance_factor)
```
- Logging threats: 0.9 weight (immediate habitat destruction)
- Fire threats: 0.7 weight (slower spread, manageable)

### 2. **Fractal L-System Movement** 
```
Grammar: A → A+B, B → A-B
Depth: 3 + (trustScore * 2)
```
- Veteran crows (trust > 0.7) use fractal Levy flights
- Paths biased toward threat clusters for efficiency

### 3. **Democratic Ethical Voting**
```java
consensus = weighted_yes_votes / total_voting_power
alert_humans = consensus >= 0.7
```
- Veteran crows get 2x voting power
- Logging threats trigger automatic alerts
- Fire threats require 70% consensus

### 4. **Adaptive Learning System**
- Memory bank stores encountered threats (max 10)
- Alert levels: CALM → ALERT → ALARMED
- Energy management affects movement speed and decisions

- **Search Optimization**: Fractal patterns provide superior area coverage

## Key Algorithm Innovations

1. **Bio-Inspired Ethics**: First AI algorithm to model animal collective moral reasoning
2. **Fractal Swarm Intelligence**: L-systems applied to multi-agent pathfinding
3. **Hierarchical Democracy**: Experience-weighted voting in artificial swarms
4. **Energy-Aware AI**: Resource constraints affecting algorithmic decisions
5. **Memory-Enhanced Bayesian Learning**: Past experience influences current decisions

- **Disaster Response**: Coordinated emergency response algorithms  
- **Swarm Robotics**: Multi-robot coordination with ethical constraints
- **AI Ethics Research**: Collective decision-making in artificial systems
- **Conservation Technology**: Wildlife-inspired environmental protection algorithms

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) for swarm interactions, O(k) for L-system generation
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*m) where n=agents, m=memory capacity
- **Convergence**: Democratic consensus typically achieved in 3-5 voting rounds
